# Assembly

A repo containing some assembly code I wrote during a learning phase. All
examples will be in Netwide Assembly (NASM).

## Prerequisites for Linux

- GCC: GNU project C and C++ compiler
- GDB: GNU Debugger
- MAKE: GNU make utility
- NASM: Netwide Assembler

You can install the required prerequisites using the following command.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential gcc gdb make nasm
```
